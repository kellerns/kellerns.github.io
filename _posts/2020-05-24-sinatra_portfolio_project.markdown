This project was a difficult one for me to say the least. Personal circumstances put a very stressful time-constraint on me for this and I was unsure if I was going to get it done, but I prevailed! Along with the aforementioned reasons, Sinatra was a subject that I had trouble grasping at the beginning and it took me longer than expected to get the hang of the patterns of CRUD and routes.

At the start of the project I decided I wanted to make a Yelp clone where the user could create reviews for any restaurant he or she wanted, and restaurants could have many reviews from different users. This was definitely a case of biting off more than I could chew. I was following along with google and youtube guides on how to make this work with 3 models and even more controllers, but I just could not understand it and was not finding where my bugs were coming from. So that's when I decided to take a step back and find a simpler project topic. That's when I steered into a new direction with a Fantasy Football database.

Having played Fantasy Football in the past, I was no stranger to the idea of having multiple teams in many different leagues. This app was designed to be able to keep someone's team info (like players and records) in a notepad-style database. The user could create new teams and record wins and losses throughout the season for each team.

This direction was tremendously more beneficial to me as a programmer because it helped me understand Sinatra on a more basic level than I would have if I had continued to beat my head against the wall with the more complex one I had started out with. Lessons are always learned, whether they are intended to be or not, and sometimes simpler is better.
