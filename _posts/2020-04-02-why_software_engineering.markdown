I graduated college with a degree in Bomedical Engineering in 2017 and started a contract in validation and quality engineering at a medical device company. When my contract was up I realized I did not want to continue to pursue that career path, so I started thinking of ways to change that. I remembered taking & liking coding classes in college, and wanted to change my major, but it was too late into undergrad to change.

This is when I started to research online coding certifications and bootcamps, and one of my friends told me about the bootcamp he did, Flatiron. I did some research, applied, and here I am now :)
